						<p>Gus and Ann Kaloidis took over the old Woodbury Antiques and Flea Market in 2008 and have been running it
							as a family business ever since. We have dealers offering a variety of merchandise for sale with an
							emphasis on early items and antiques. The market is open every Saturday.<br>
						</p>

							required, walk-ins are welcome, but you may call us to let us know you are coming at: (203) 263-6217. Ask
							management for special rates.</p>
						
						<p>Customers are invited after 7:30 A.M. We offer ample parking around the restaurant. Parking attendents
							are available to assist you. Admission is FREE and handicap parking is also available.</p>
						
						<p>This is a continuation of the old Woodbury Antiques and Flea market from around the corner (Route 63
							Middle Quarter Road), that had been in business for over forty years. Don and Diane Heavens owned and
							operated the market until they sold their property in 2006.</p>
						
						<p>The Market is easily accessible from I-84 and it is one and one- half hours away from NY City. The
							nearest airports are Oxford and Danbury. The Market is located at the bottom of Sherman Hill Road near the
							intersection of routes 6 and 64.</p>
